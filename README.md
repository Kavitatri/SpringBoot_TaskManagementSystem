📝 Task Management Application
🚀 Project Overview
The Task Management Application is a simple web application that allows users to manage tasks in a to-do list format. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, which include attributes like task name, description, due date, and status.

🛠 Tech Stack:
🎨 Frontend: Angular, Bootstrap
🖥 Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
🗄 Database: H2 (In-memory)
❓ Problem Statement
Managing tasks manually can lead to missed deadlines and confusion. This application provides a digital solution to efficiently manage and track tasks, improving productivity for both individuals and teams.

🔑 Key Features
✅ Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and status.
👀 Task Viewing: Users can view a list of all tasks with details such as title, description, and status.
✏️ Task Update: Users can modify task details, including the title, description, due date, and completion status.
🗑 Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.

🏗 Technology Stack
🎨 Frontend
🅰️ Angular – A powerful framework for building Single Page Applications (SPA).
🎨 Bootstrap – For responsive design and styling.
⚙ Backend
☕ Spring Boot – A Java-based framework for building RESTful APIs with minimal configuration.
📂 Spring Data JPA – For efficient database interaction.
🗄 H2 Database – An in-memory database for easy development (can be replaced with MySQL/PostgreSQL in production).
🏛 Architecture Overview
The application follows a client-server architecture, where:
📡 The Angular frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend using RESTful APIs.
🔗 The backend exposes endpoints for managing tasks, while the frontend consumes these endpoints to display and manipulate data.

📌 Setup Instructions
⚡ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js & Angular CLI (for frontend)
Java & Spring Boot (for backend)
H2 Database (or any other DB if needed)
